          I'm Mohammad Hafizuddin from Penang, currently pursuing a Computer
          Science degree at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) with a
          specialization in Database Management. I'm interested in how data
          systems and web technologies can improve real-world efficiency.

    <h4>Book Rental Management System</h4>
    <p>
      This project is a simple system designed to manage book rentals for
      libraries or bookstores. It allows users to browse available books, rent
      them, and track their return dates. The system also includes basic
      features for administrators to add, update, and remove books from the
      catalog. It was developed in Java during my first year of study at
      Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) as part of a coursework project
      to understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and database
      integration.

    <h4>Tourism Management System</h4>
    <p>
      The Tourism Management System was developed to simplify how travel
      agencies and tourists manage travel information. It helps users explore
      destinations, plan trips, and manage bookings in one place. Administrators
      can add new destinations, update tour packages, and view customer details
      through the system. This project was created using MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript to practice database connectivity, user interface design,
      and data handling. It was an important step in understanding how
      real-world management systems work behind the scenes.

    <h4>Paperwork Management System</h4>
    <p>
      The Paperwork Management System was designed to help organizations store,
      organize, and track digital documents efficiently. It allows users to
      upload, categorize, and retrieve files easily, reducing the need for
      manual record-keeping. Administrators can manage user access and monitor
      document activity to ensure security and proper workflow. This project was
      developed using MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, focusing on database
      management, file handling, and user interface design. It strengthened my
      understanding of how digital systems can replace traditional paperwork in
      real-world environments.
